# .dotfiles

Sooner or later, every developer gets tired of wrestling with their local setup: manual installations, missing dependencies, "it worked on my previous setup" headaches. That's the moment you stop fighting and start automating.

This repository is my personal arsenal of dotfiles and scripts to spin up a development environment in minutes, not days. 🤠

## Kickstart

To get started, clone the repository and run the installation script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kamtugeza/dotfiles.git "${HOME}/.dotfiles" && bash "${HOME}/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```
